\arguments{
\item{object}{A named list of prediction models, where allowed
entries are (1) R-objects for which a \link{predictSurvProb} method
exists (see details), (2) a \code{call} that evaluates to such an
R-object (see examples), (3) a matrix with predicted probabilities
having as many rows as \code{data} and as many columns as
\code{times}. For cross-validation all objects in this list must
include their \code{call}.}

\item{time}{The evaluation time point at predicted event
probabilities are plotted against pseudo-observed event status.}

\item{formula}{A survival or event history formula. The left hand
side is used to compute the expected event status. If
\code{formula} is \code{missing}, try to extract a formula from the
first element in object.}

\item{data}{A data frame in which to validate the prediction models
and to fit the censoring model. If \code{data} is missing, try to
extract a data set from the first element in object.}

\item{splitMethod}{Defines the internal validation design:

\code{none/noPlan}: Assess the models in the give \code{data}, usually
either in the same data where they are fitted, or in independent test data.

\code{BootCv}: Bootstrap cross validation. The prediction models
are trained on \code{B} bootstrap samples, that are either drawn
with replacement of the same size as the original data or without
replacement from \code{data} of the size \code{M}.  The models are
assessed in the observations that are NOT in the bootstrap sample.}

\item{B}{The number of cross-validation steps.}

\item{M}{The size of the subsamples for cross-validation.}

\item{outcome}{The method for estimating expected event status:

\code{"pseudo"}: Use average pseudo-values.  \code{"prodlim"}: Use
the product-limit estimate, i.e., apply the Kaplan-Meier method for
right censored survival and the Aalen-Johansen method for right
censored competing risks data.}

\item{showPseudo}{If \code{TRUE} and \code{outcome=="pseudo"} the
pseudo-values are shown as dots on the plot.}

\item{pseudo.col}{Colour for pseudo-values.}

\item{pseudo.pch}{Dot type (see par) for pseudo-values.}

\item{method}{The method for estimating the calibration curve(s):

\code{"nne"}: The expected event status is obtained in the nearest
neighborhood around the predicted event probabilities.

\code{"quantile"}: The expected event status is obtained in groups
defined by quantiles of the predicted event probabilities.}

\item{round}{If \code{TRUE} predicted probabilities are rounded to
two digits before smoothing. This may have a considerable effect on
computing efficiency in large data sets.}

\item{bandwidth}{The bandwidth for \code{method="nne"}}

\item{q}{The number of quantiles for \code{method="quantile"}.}

\item{jack.density}{Gray scale for pseudo-observations.}

\item{add}{If \code{TRUE} the line(s) are added to an existing
plot.}

\item{diag}{If \code{FALSE} no diagonal line is drawn.}

\item{legend}{If \code{FALSE} no legend is drawn.}

\item{axes}{If \code{FALSE} no axes are drawn.}

\item{xlim}{Limits of x-axis.}

\item{ylim}{Limits of y-axis.}

\item{xlab}{Label for y-axis.}

\item{ylab}{Label for x-axis.}

\item{col}{Vector with colors, one for each element of
object. Passed to \code{\link{lines}}.}

\item{lwd}{Vector with line widths, one for each element of
object. Passed to \code{\link{lines}}.}

\item{lty}{lwd Vector with line style, one for each element of
object.  Passed to \code{\link{lines}}.}

\item{pch}{Passed to \code{\link{points}}.}

\item{cause}{For competing risks models, the cause of failure or
event of interest}

\item{percent}{If TRUE axes labels are multiplied by 100 and thus
interpretable on a percent scale.}

\item{giveToModel}{List of with exactly one entry for each entry in
\code{object}. Each entry names parts of the value of the fitted
models that should be extracted and added to the value.}

\item{na.action}{Passed to \code{\link{model.frame}}}

\item{cores}{Number of cores for parallel computing.  Passed as
value of argument \code{mc.cores} to \code{\link{mclapply}}.}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE} report details of the progress,
e.g. count the steps in cross-validation.}

\item{...}{Used to control the subroutines: plot, axis, lines,
legend. See \code{\link{SmartControl}}.}

\value{
list with elements: time, pseudoFrame and bandwidth (NULL for method
quantile).

\description{
Calibration plots for risk prediction models in right censored survival and
competing risks data
}
\details{
For method "nne" the optimal bandwidth with respect to is obtained with the
function \code{\link{dpik}} from the package \code{KernSmooth} for a box
kernel function.
